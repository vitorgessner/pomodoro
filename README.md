# 🍅 Pomodoro - project from roadmapsh

My idea with this project was to study and practice some concepts with React.js, among them:

- Context api and useContext
- useReducer
- Tailwind
- Typescript
- Shadcn/ui

While coding the project, I was able to learn with my mistakes, improve my skills with the technologies mentioned above, and learn a bit more about code splitting. I feel much more encouraged to work on future projects using these technologies.
