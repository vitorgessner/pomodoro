# 🍅 Pomodoro - project from roadmapsh

The project consists of implementing a timer for the Pomodoro technique. The initial timers are set to: 25 minutes for work/study sessions, 5 minutes for short breaks, and 15 minutes for long breaks after four work/study sessions. However, you can change these values according to your needs. The idea was taken from Roadmap.sh

My idea with this project was to study and practice some concepts with React.js, among them:

While coding the project, I was able to learn with my mistakes, improve my skills with the technologies mentioned above, and learn a bit more about code splitting. I feel much more encouraged to work on future projects using these technologies.
